# Awesome List Prettied

<div align="center">

    <p>
        <a href="https://awesome.paulrossethings.com">Awesome Pretty List 💅🏻</a>
    </p>
</div>

## Motivation

The awesome lists are truly **awesome** 😅 to find and promote open source project but sometimes it becomes really painful to browse them. To answer this problem i've built an app to browse them easily.  
Data are extracted from [Official Awesome List (root)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## Parser

In order to get the data from the official awesome list, i've also built a small parser to quickly build a json object with all awesome list in it to index them.

Use of [parser](https://github.com/PaulRosset/awesome-list-pretty/tree/master/parser):

```sh
Usage: parse.py -s(SingleObject)|-m(MultipleObject) -f <filename>
```

## Left to-do

- Automation at each pull request merged from the [Official Awesome List (root)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
- Add new features...
